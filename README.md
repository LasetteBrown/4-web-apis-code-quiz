# 4-web-apis-code-quiz

A project to demonstrate my knowledge of Web APIs through a quiz about coding.


## User Story

```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on coding fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```
## Purpose and Scope

The website is designed to allow the user to take a short quiz about coding knowledge. The quiz is 12 questions long and the user has 90 seconds to answer all of them. 10 seconds are deducted from this time for every wrong answer. At the end of the quiz the user has the option to input their initials, which will be displayed on the high scores page along with their score. On the high scores page, the scores are ranked highest to lowest. 

The high scores page uses local browser storage to store user scores. As such, the user can only see their rank in comparison with other quizes taken on the same browser. Further this feature is limited to computer usage as mobile devices store browser information differently.

Once the user has answered all 12 questions, or if the timer runs out, the quiz is over. A window alert will display showing the user score. Then a prompt will ask for the user's initials, and the page will be redirected to the High Scores page.

The users initials will be displayed alongside their score, ranked among all quiz scores.
